## Problem

- Like regular companies, non-profit organizations have to pay salaries, expenses, etc.
- Many rely on donations. Donations are a money transfer, not an investment.
- The usage of the donated money is often not transparent.
- Donating conflicts with the individuals wish for personal financial gain.

## Solution

- Staking is a crypto investment that generates reliable interest.
- Create a Celo staking group and pay out the generated interest to non-profit initiatives of the users choice.

## TechStack used

- Web 2.0 app (Next.JS, Supabase)
- Celo Network (Validator, Validator Group, Smart Contract)
